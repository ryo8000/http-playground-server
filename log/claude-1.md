> Create src/utils/shutdown.ts and standardize the server shutdown process in src/server.ts and src/routes/shutdown.ts. However, src/routes/shutdown.ts currently
  calls process.exit(0); immediately when it receives a request, so please shut down the server in the same way as src/server.ts.

● I'll create a standardized shutdown utility and update the shutdown process. Let me first examine the current code to understand the shutdown mechanisms.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Examine current shutdown implementation in src/server.ts
     ☐ Examine current shutdown route in src/routes/shutdown.ts

     /**

      */
     export function gracefulShutdown(server: Server): void {
       if (isShuttingDown) {

● Now I'll update server.ts to use the new shutdown utility:

● Update(src/server.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/server.ts with 1 addition
       1    import { app } from './app.js';
       2    import { environment } from './env.js';
       3    import { log } from './logger.js';
       4 +  import { gracefulShutdown } from './utils/shutdown.js';
       5
       6    const server = app.listen(environment.port, () => {
       7      log.info(`Server is running on http://localhost:${environment.port}`);

● Update(src/server.ts)

       15 -
       14    process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
       15 -    if (isShuttingDown) {
       16 -      log.warn('Shutdown already in progress...');
       17 -      return;
       18 -    }
       19 -    isShuttingDown = true;
       20 -
       21 -    log.info('SIGTERM signal received: closing HTTP server');
       22 -
       23 -    const forceExitTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
       24 -      log.error('Server close timed out, forcing exit');
       25 -      process.exit(1);
       26 -    }, 10_000);
       27 -
       28 -    server.close((err) => {
       29 -      clearTimeout(forceExitTimeout);
       30 -
       31 -      if (err) {
       32 -        log.error({ err }, 'Error during server close');
       33 -        process.exit(1);
       34 -      }
       35 -
       36 -      log.info('HTTP server closed');
       37 -      process.exit(0);
       38 -    });
       15 +    log.info('SIGTERM signal received');
       16 +    gracefulShutdown(server);
       17    });

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine current shutdown implementation in src/server.ts
     ☒ Examine current shutdown route in src/routes/shutdown.ts
     ☒ Create src/utils/shutdown.ts with standardized shutdown logic
     ☒ Update src/server.ts to use the new shutdown utility
     ☐ Update src/routes/shutdown.ts to use the new shutdown utility

● Now I need to update the shutdown route to use the graceful shutdown instead of process.exit(0). I'll need to get access to the server instance:

● Read(src/app.ts)
  ⎿  Read 74 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to modify the approach. The server instance is created in server.ts, so I'll need to pass it to the shutdown route. Let me update the shutdown utility to
  export the server instance and modify the route accordingly:

● Update(src/utils/shutdown.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/utils/shutdown.ts with 17 additions and 2 removals
        2    import { log } from '../logger.js';
        3
        4    let isShuttingDown = false;
        5 +  let serverInstance: Server | null = null;
        6
        7    /**
        8 +   * Set the server instance for shutdown operations
        9 +   */
       10 +  export function setServerInstance(server: Server): void {
       11 +    serverInstance = server;
       12 +  }
       13 +
       14 +  /**
       15     * Gracefully shutdown the HTTP server
       16     */
       17 -  export function gracefulShutdown(server: Server): void {
       17 +  export function gracefulShutdown(server?: Server): void {
       18 +    const targetServer = server || serverInstance;
       19 +
       20 +    if (!targetServer) {
       21 +      log.error('No server instance available for shutdown');
       22 +      process.exit(1);
       23 +    }
       24 +
       25      if (isShuttingDown) {
       26        log.warn('Shutdown already in progress...');
       27        return;
     ...
       20        process.exit(1);
       21      }, 10_000);
       22
       23 -    server.close((err) => {
       23 +    targetServer.close((err) => {
       24        clearTimeout(forceExitTimeout);
       25
       26        if (err) {

● Now I'll update server.ts to set the server instance:

● Update(src/server.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/server.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal
       1    import { app } from './app.js';
       2    import { environment } from './env.js';
       3    import { log } from './logger.js';
       4 -  import { gracefulShutdown } from './utils/shutdown.js';
       4 +  import { gracefulShutdown, setServerInstance } from './utils/shutdown.js';
       5
       6    const server = app.listen(environment.port, () => {
       7      log.info(`Server is running on http://localhost:${environment.port}`);

● Update(src/server.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/server.ts with 3 additions
       11    server.requestTimeout = environment.requestTimeout;
       12    server.keepAliveTimeout = environment.keepAliveTimeout;
       13
       14 +  // Set the server instance for shutdown operations
       15 +  setServerInstance(server);
       16 +
       17    process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
       18      log.info('SIGTERM signal received');
       19      gracefulShutdown(server);

● Now I'll update the shutdown route to use the graceful shutdown utility:

● Update(src/routes/shutdown.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/routes/shutdown.ts with 1 addition
       1    import { Router } from 'express';
       2    import { environment } from '../env.js';
       3    import { HttpStatusCodes } from '../utils/http.js';
       4 +  import { gracefulShutdown } from '../utils/shutdown.js';
       5
       6    const shutdownRouter = Router();
       7

● Update(src/routes/shutdown.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src/routes/shutdown.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal
       16      }
       17
       18      res.json({ message: 'Server shutting down' });
       19 -    process.exit(0);
       19 +    gracefulShutdown();
       20    });
       21
       22    export { shutdownRouter };

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine current shutdown implementation in src/server.ts
     ☒ Examine current shutdown route in src/routes/shutdown.ts
     ☒ Create src/utils/shutdown.ts with standardized shutdown logic
     ☒ Update src/server.ts to use the new shutdown utility
     ☒ Update src/routes/shutdown.ts to use the new shutdown utility

● Perfect! I've successfully created src/utils/shutdown.ts and standardized the server shutdown process across both src/server.ts and src/routes/shutdown.ts.

  The key changes:

  1. Created src/utils/shutdown.ts with:
    - gracefulShutdown() function implementing the same graceful shutdown logic that was in server.ts
    - setServerInstance() function to store the server reference for route-based shutdowns
    - 10-second timeout with forced exit if graceful shutdown fails
  2. Updated src/server.ts to:
    - Import and use the new shutdown utility
    - Set the server instance for shutdown operations
    - Use gracefulShutdown(server) in the SIGTERM handler
  3. Updated src/routes/shutdown.ts to:
    - Import and use gracefulShutdown() instead of process.exit(0)
    - Now performs the same graceful shutdown as the SIGTERM handler

  Both shutdown mechanisms now use the same standardized process: they attempt to gracefully close the HTTP server with a 10-second timeout before forcing exit.
